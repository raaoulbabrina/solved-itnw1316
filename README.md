5. You’re trying to decide which disk technology to use on your new server. The server will be in heavy use around the clock every day, so high performance is a necessity. Which technology is the best choice?

6. You can use a 32-bit processor to install the Hyper-V role as long as it supports virtualization extensions. True or False?

7. Which networking protocol is installed by default in Windows Server 2008? (Choose all that apply.)

8. Which of the following is not a typical Windows Server 2008 post-installation task?

9. Which of the following is a task you must do during Windows Server 2008 installation?

10. What command should you use to test your IP configuration settings after a new Windows Server 2008 installation?

11. Which graphical utility runs in Server Core?

12. You installed Windows Server 2008 recently, and it has been running well for the past several days. You read about a critical security patch that has been available for about a week. You view the currently installed updates in Control Panel’s Programs and Features and don’t see any installed updates. You need to install this update immediately and make sure your server is kept up to date without your intervention in the future. What should you do?

13. Which of the following is a reason for installing a new server? (Choose all that apply.)

14. Windows Server Core is a good installation option with all but which of the following?

15. You approach one of your servers running Server Core and you see a completely blank desktop except for the mouse pointer. You need to do some management tasks on the server. What should you do?

16. What command do you use to configure addresses for network interfaces?

17. You have just finished installing Windows Server 2008. You have assigned a server name and configured IP addresses. You have tested your configuration by using Ping to verify network connectivity with your default gateway and another server on the network, and everything worked fine. However, the next day a colleague tells you that when he tried to ping the server, his request timed out. You try to ping your colleague’s computer and receive a reply just fine. Why can’t your colleague ping your server successfully?

18. Which command do you use to restart Server Core?

19. In Server Core, which command do you use to join your server to a Windows domain?

20. Which of the following is the default setting for Windows Update after a new Windows Server 2008 installation?

21. You’re about to install a new application on Windows Server 2008 running in Hyper-V. You’re concerned that this application might cause conflicts with other applications and services on the virtual machine. You can take the server down for a short time if necessary, but you’re concerned that if the application does cause problems, getting the server back in working order could take quite a long time. What is the best course of action?

22. The layer of software sitting between the server hardware and OS that allows multiple OSs to share hardware resources is called which of the following?

23. Virtual machines must be allocated a minimum of 1 GB RAM to run properly. True or False?

24. Which of the following is an advantage of using virtual machines? (Choose all that apply.)

25. You want to install a new server in Hyper-V. You create the virtual machine and insert the installation DVD, only to find that the DVD drive on your server has failed. You need to install this virtual machine today and don’t have any spare DVD drives handy, nor do you want to shut down the server to install a DVD drive, if you can avoid it. What can you do?

26. Cool Gadgets, has been running Windows Server 2008 32-bit Standard Edition, which you installed about six months ago. Cool Gadgets is running the Active Directory Domain Services, DNS, IIS, and File Services roles. The number of computer clients has grown from 25 to 50 in the past six months, and additional growth is expected. Cool Gadgets just purchased an expensive material requirements planning (MRP) system to help manage production. This application has hefty memory (4 GB or more) and CPU requirements (recommended 2.0 GHz dual-core processor). All desktop computers will have the MRP client application installed. The owner doesn’t want to install the MRP client application on mobile users’ laptops, so a remote solution is needed for these systems. The owner also mentions that he’s familiar with this application and will need to log on to the server periodically to do maintenance and monitoring.

The owner tells you that in the future, Cool Gadgets might need system fault tolerance to ensure that there’s little or no downtime because this critical application will eventually be accessed at all times of the day and night. For now, he’s just concerned about getting the system up and running. You check the existing server’s capacity and determine that the new application’s memory and disk requirements will likely exceed the existing server’s 4 GB capabilities. The owner explains that there’s enough budget for a new server, so you should plan for growth. As an aside, he mentions that because all his employees log on at about the same time, the time it takes to log on has been increasing. You need to come up with specifications for a new server. Describe some hardware features you will recommend for this new server, in particular the CPU architecture, number of processors, amount of RAM, and disk system. Explain your answers.

27. You have your new server for the Cool Gadgets upgrade project and are ready to install Windows Server 2008. Case Project 2-1 describes the current environment and requirements of Cool Gadgets. Which edition of Windows Server 2008 will you install? Include information on 32-bit or 64-bit versions and whether it should be a full or Server Core installation. Explain your answer.

28. You have finished installing Windows Server 2008 on the new server for Cool Gadgets. Next, you need to decide what to name the server and how it will participate in the existing domain: as a domain controller, a member server, or a stand-alone server. The server will be located near the existing server, named CG-Server1-DC, in the equipment closet. Make a list of the post installation tasks to perform on this server, including details on the server name and its role in the domain (if any). Don’t include installing specific server roles just yet.

29. You have finished post installation tasks for the new server, and now you need to decide which server roles you will install on it. Reread Case Project 2-1 carefully, which provides most of the information you need to make an informed decision. List which server roles you will install and explain why.
